# DMTScripts

These scripts are designed to be used withthe Epicor DMT tool, 
to automate as much as possible the setup of a new company in Epicor 10.

The passwords are set as environment variables, such as refering to %PW% 
in the scripts.  You would set it in the Advanced configuration.  
I normally set them as a Computer variable, but you could also set them as 
a user environment variable in Windows.
